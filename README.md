# Forage-Simulations

Forage is an online platform that provides free virtual work experiences and offers simulated work tasks created by leading companies to help students gain practical skills.

These are short, self-paced programs that cover various sectors including technology, security and finance.

I will be mostly attempting the security section of job simulations.
